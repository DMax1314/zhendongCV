## Research Experience

### Shanghai University
**Shanghai Univeristy Operator Research and Optimization Open Lab**

Research Assistant  
Sept. 2020 - present  
- Developed an optimal control problem solver to solve nonlinear optimal control problem based on the control parameterization method with Julia and used some methods such as AdaGrad and adaptive switching time technique;  
- Designed an inexact Uzawa algorithm framework based on the special structure by using dual form of the ellipse optimal control problem and its nonlinear saddle point problems;
- Solved  Graph Matching problem in Integer PDE optimal control problems with revised ADMM.

### Polytechique de Montreal   
Research Intern,  
Aug. 2022 - Nov. 2022

 -  Assisted in development of a simulation tool in python to test the dispatch process and developed greedy algorithms for the Dial a Ride problem in NYC;
 -  Implemented dedicated algorithms to compute compatibility matrices and developed visualization tools.

### The University of Melbourne
Research Intern,  
April 2022 - Present

- Used origin and destination of the line and selected new stops to get a `better' bus line. Modeled it as an Orienteering Problem with more real constraints also mixed the point of interest, the convenience of transferring to the subway and other things as score in data set；
- Used SVM method to reduce the complexity of the network to solve the problem faster with the heuristics solver;
- Our solution will have a chance to conduct real experiments in Tongzhou District, Beijing.

### Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences
Research Associate,  
June 2021 - April 2022
- Proposed a novel pivot selecting rules to Simplex method for Mixed Integer Programming, by employing Reinforcement Learning techniques;
- Learned the basic knowledge about integer programming and reinforcement learning;
- Tested classical methods such as Bland's rule and steepest edge rule and on Vehicle Routing Problem.
